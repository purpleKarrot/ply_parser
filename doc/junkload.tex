PLY files are common\\
used for big data\\
often only a part of this data is required\\
no routine available to get this part\\
implement a generic library for this purpose\\

\section{Introduction}
The PLY file format is a simple object description that was designed as a
convenient format for researchers who work with polygonal models.

A PLY file consists of a header followed by a list of vertices and then a list of
polygons. The header specifies how many vertices and polygons are in the file,
and also states what properties are associated with each vertex, such as (x,y,z)
coordinates, normals and color. The polygon faces are simply lists of indices
into the vertex list, and each face begins with a count of the number of elements
in each list.

Source code for programs that read and write PLY files can be found in the PLY
code archive. This archive includes programs to transform polygonal objects,
calculate surface normals, flip faces and determine the spatial bounds of an
object. We plan to make additional tools available in the near future.

\subsection{related work}
%
ply.c and libply

\subsubsection{ply.c}
written in c\\
old\\
does not compile on modern compilers\\
only covers ply core\\

\subsubsection{libply}
\url{http://people.cs.kuleuven.be/~ares.lagae/libply/}
uses boost and tr1\\
covers full spec\\
uses callbacks (for all combination of types!)\\

\subsection{about generic programming and concepts}
%
what is generic programming\\
what are concepts\\
which concepts are required for chunk loaders\\
which concepts do different file reading libraries provide?\\
can we wrap them?\\
is it useful?\\
conclusion: streams have to be read in one run\\

\subsection{multithreading}
%
one file!\\
threadsafe, as long as each file is accessed from one thread only!\\
-> build single threaded, then use std::async or Boost.Thread.\\

\subsection{about ply}
different meaning of 'generic'\\
handling generic data is close to impossible in static typed language\\
instead, convert to the format that the user requires\\
this can be achieved with generic programming\\

\section{approach}
%
header has always the same grammar (show EBNF)\\
body grammar is built from header\\
lex-yacc not possible\\
spirit possible\\
spirit also much less verbose, direct EBNF conversion\\
show header grammar in spirit\\
body grammar generation\\
output type cannot be build, subparser need to insert their value\\

\section{application}
%
\subsection{provided}
forward wrapper (spirit)\\
line saver for error messages (spirit)\\
iostream for .gz and .bz2 (iostreams)\\
async (c++0x or Boost.Task or Boost.Thread?)\\

\subsection{custom}
parser: parse line depending on grammar\\
p\_iter: InputIterator parses input lines on increment\\
interval: OutputIterator wrapper, ignore outside of interval\\

\section{examples}
read interval from .ply.gz in parallel thread and enable error output.
