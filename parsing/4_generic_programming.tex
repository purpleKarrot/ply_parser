\section{Generic Programming}

Generic programming is about writing code that is independent of the types of
objects being manipulated. The \texttt{memcpy()} function of the C standard
library is generalized at the price of type safety by the use of \texttt{void*}.
In C++, class and function templates make the generalization possible without
sacrificing type safety
\cite{Alexandrescu:2001:MCD:377789,Meyers:2005:ECS:1051335}.

The set of requirements consisting of valid expressions, associated types,
invariants and complexity guarantees is summarized as a \emph{concept}. A type
that satisfies the requirements is said to \emph{model the concept}. A concept
can extend the requirements of another concept, which is called
\emph{refinement} \cite{gregor08:devx_concepts}. The concepts used in the C++
Standard Library are documented at the SGI STL
site\footnote{\url{http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/table_of_contents.html}}.
