\section{Conclusion}

The proposed library does not sacrifice type safety while being extremely
generic. Using it does not require the registration of any callback functions
and is thus much less complex  than using libply.


While being extremely complex internally, libraries using the techniques
described in this paper provide a very simple interface to application
developers and are resistant to programming errors.


The implementation itself is extremely complex. While completely abstracted from
the programmer, the library needs to handle expressions for all possible
property types. This provides very high flexibility. The impact in performance
of this complexity still has to be investigated. It is also questionable whether
this high flexibility is really required.
