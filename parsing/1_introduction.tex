\section{Introduction}

In the context of data storage and transmission, parsing plays a fundamental
role. Whenever a file is loaded from a disk or a network protocol is
interpreted, the file or stream content needs to be parsed and converted into a
data structure or object.

In simple cases, the file content is an exact representation of the data
structure. More general file formats and protocols provide a \emph{header}
information that describes the content of the \emph{body}.

A generic parser should be able to parse the body of a file or network packet,
with respect to the information from the respective header, thus generate a
parser from the formal grammar specified by the header. Because knowledge about
this grammar is deferred until runtime, let us call it a \emph{dynamic grammar}.

The application developer that uses a parser library specifies a class or data
structure that should be initialized by the parser. The parser has to initialize
this structure, no matter what the contents of the file really are. Because this
structure defines a type and C++ is a statically typed language, the semantics
of the parser is \emph{static}.

In this paper I present an approach of building a general parser from a dynamic
grammar and static semantics. As an example application, I demonstrate a parser
for the Polygon File Format (PLY) using the techniques described in this paper.
